# Data Flow For Java

Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability. - Edsger W. Dijkstra
-------------------------

df4j is an abbreviation of "Data Flow for Java". It is a library to support asynchronous computations of all flavours: futures, promises, asynchronous procedure calls, actors, reactive streams.

For those interested in history of dataflow programming, I recommend to start with the [definition in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dataflow_programming)
and then short introductory article "Dataflow Programming: Concept, Languages and Applications" by Tiago Boldt Sousa.

The primary goal of this library is to investigate the anatomy of asynchronous programming.
So this project avoids highly optimized cryptic code usually found in such library. The main goal was to make readable code.

The asynchronous programming always attracted Java programmers,
and the absence of a complete asynchronous support in language and runtime only stimulated programmers to find their own solutions.
Today some asynchronous libraries for Java are very popular, e.g. rx-java, vert.x, Akka.
However, all they imply steep learning curve and hides implementation details under the hood.
df4j ia an attempt to discover the basic building elements of asynchronous computations,
and allow developer to freely combine those elements, and add new ones.
It resembles children's building kit: a set of small parts which can be connected together and be assembled in arbitrary complex constructs.

The foundation principles are following:

1. Any parallel computation can be represented as a (dataflow) graph, which consists of 2 kinds of nodes: activities and connectors.
Activities compute tokens (values and signals), connectors pass them between activities.
2. Activities can be of two kinds: threads and asynchronous procedures.
3. Asynchronous procedure consists of:
  - asynchronous parameters (represented as connectors)
  - user-defined synchronous procedure,
  - reference to an Executor, and
  - an object that glues all that components together. Below this object is referenced as a "node of dataflow graph", or just a "node".
4. Connector has several important characteristics:
 - which protocol it implements
 - can play the role of asyncronous parameter. The execution of the node starts exactly after all such parameters are filled with tokens.
 - can be used for input or output.
 - can connect asynchronous procedures and/or threads

This library has implementations for following protocols:

1. Scalar messages: this is the protocol used in CompletableFuture. At most one message or an error is sent.
2. Permit stream. This is the protocol used in Semahores. This library expands it to asynchronous connectors.
3. Reactive message streams, as defined in the package org.reactivestreams.

Asynchronous procedure does not produce return value, as synchronous procedures usually do, so output connectors are necessary. 
A node can have multiple input and multiple output connectors.
Nodes are connected by their connectors: output connector of one node is connected to input connector of another node.
 - Connectors can implement different exchange protocols. Connected connectors must implement the same protocol.
 
The main results of this work are:

1. Differentiation between connectors and nodes. 
This allows to develop connectors independently of nodes and make use of new protocols with already developed node types.
As a result, this library is very compact. 
It does not contain fluent API and does not try to implement [all combinations of all capabilities](https://www.google.ru/search?q="all+combinations+of+all+capabilities),
but allow developers to freely combine existing and newly developed capabilities.

2. Actors (e.g. [Akka](https://akka.io/)) are no more than repeatable asynchronous procedures.

3. Reactive streams are just implementation of a specific protocol, and that protocol is no more but a combination of two more simple protocols. 
Reactive streams in asynchronous programming plays the same role as blocking queues in multithreading programming: probably most useful,
but by far not the only way to connect independent parties. 

See examples and test directories for various custom-made dataflow objects and their usage.
